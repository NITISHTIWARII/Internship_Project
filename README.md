I created a project that displays user data from an API, including first name, last name, ID, UID, email, phone number, password, and profile image.

I started by designing the UI using LinearGradient to give it a beautiful and modern look. I took inspiration from example UIs on Google and customized the design to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

After completing the UI, I integrated the API into the project. I also added "Next" and "Previous" functions, allowing users to navigate through the data by tapping the arrow icons. When the "Next" icon is tapped, it fetches the next user's data, and when the "Previous" icon is tapped, it shows the previous user's data.

I hope you like my work! I am passionate about React Native and love developing mobile applications. I'm eager to improve my skills and look forward to opportunities that will help me grow as a React Native developer. If you have any feedback, I would love to hear it â€” it will help me become even better!
